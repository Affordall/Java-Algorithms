## What's been implemented:
- [**QuickHull**](https://github.com/Affordall/Java-Algorithms/blob/master/src/com/algorithms/impl/quick_hull/QuickHull.java) - is an algorithm to compute the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane. Its average case complexity is O(n*log n) and in in the worst case O(n^2).

- **HeapPermute** - generates all possible permutations of N objects.

- **FibonacciHeap** - is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees.
